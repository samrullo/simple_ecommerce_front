# New category or Brand

When creating a new product, right now user can specify Category and Brand by typing text into input field.
But I want to enable the user to choose from existing categories and brands.
So in the form, next to Category and Brand labels add a checkbox that says "New Category/Brand".
When the checkbox is toggled on, user will enter new category name as text into input field.
When the checkbox is toggled off, user will choose from existing categories.
